Feature: User Interface: The system shall allow administrators to commit changes, reject changes, reset and delete the drafted changes.

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Draft Mode is functioning as expected

    Scenario: B.4.20.0700.100.
    This feature test is REDUNDANT and can be viewed in A.6.4.0400.100 and A.6.4.0400.200

    # Scenario: A.6.4.0400.100 User's ability to approve draft changes without administrative approval
    # Scenario: A.6.4.0400.200 User's ability to approve draft changes without administrative approval if no existing fields were modified
