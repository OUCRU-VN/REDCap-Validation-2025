Feature: B.6.11.1000. User Interface: The system shall allow the REDCap Administrator to override Record Limits when create or copying a project
# This record override is only applicable when set at the global level. This is the case because project level record limits are specific to that project, so the copised project would not have the project record limit already set. 

As a REDCap end user
I want to see that My Project is functioning as expected
