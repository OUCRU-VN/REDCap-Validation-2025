Feature: B.6.11.0700 Project Settings: The system shall retain project-level record limit settings when a production project is moved back into development status.

As a REDCap Administrator
I want to verify that record limit settings persist appropriately when moving a project between production and development

    Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
