Feature: Project Interface Administrator Access: The system shall support the administrator role's ability to perform the following actions with specifying the reason on the randomization module allocation table: perform edit target field, edit target allocation, manual randomization, and make sequence unavailable.
  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that Randomization is functioning as expected

 Scenario: #SETUP - Create new project
    Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_User1"
    And I create a new project named "C.3.30.1800" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project 3.30 baserand.REDCap.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button
    
    #Adding user rights Test_User1 (with randomize rights)
    When I click on the link labeled "User Rights"
    And I enter "Test_User1" into the field with the placeholder text of "Assign new user to role"
    And I click on the button labeled "Assign to role"
    And I select "1_FullRights" on the dropdown field labeled "Select Role" on the role selector dropdown
    When I click on the button labeled exactly "Assign" on the role selector dropdown
    Then I should see "test_user1" within the "1_FullRights" row of the column labeled "Username" of the User Rights table
       
    #SETUP Creating randomiztion stategy and adding allocation table.
    When I click on the link labeled "Setup"

    Then I should see "Already uploaded"

    #Adding record with randomization
