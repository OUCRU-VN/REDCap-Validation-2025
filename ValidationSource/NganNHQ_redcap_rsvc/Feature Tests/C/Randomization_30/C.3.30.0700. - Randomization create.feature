Feature: C.3.30.0700 User Interface: The system shall ensure users with Randomization Setup can create and modify randomization models while in project development mode.
  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that Randomization is functioning as expected
  
Scenario: #SETUP project with randomization enabled
