Feature: C.3.30.1500.	User Interface: The system shall support blinded and open randomization models, with access to allocation details based on user permissions and model setup.
As a REDCap end user
I want to see that Randomization is functioning as expected

Scenario: #SETUP project with randomization enabled
    Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_User1"
    And I create a new project named "C.3.30.1500." by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project 3.30 baserand.REDCap.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button
    
    #Adding user rights Test_User1 (with randomize rights)
