Feature: User Interface: The system shall support the e-Consent Framework to limit user view access (i.e., DAG).
   As a REDCap end user
   I want to see that eConsent is functioning as expected

  Scenario: C.3.24.1700.100 Limit user view access by DAG
      #SETUP
    Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
    And I create a new project named "C.3.24.1700.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "24EConsentWithSetup.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button
