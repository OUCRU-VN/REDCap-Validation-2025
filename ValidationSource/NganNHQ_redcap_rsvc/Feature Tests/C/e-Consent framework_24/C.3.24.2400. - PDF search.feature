Feature: User Interface: The system shall support the search function within PDF snapshots.


   As a REDCap end user
   I want to see that eConsent is functioning as expected

   Scenario:  C.3.24.2400.100 search function within PDF snapshots.

      #SETUP
      Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
      And I create a new project named "C.3.24.2400.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "24EConsentWithSetup.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button


      ##ACTION: Search function
      When I click on the link labeled "Designer"
      And I click on the button labeled "PDF Snapshot"
      Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in a table:
         | Active | Edit settings         | Name       | Type of trigger   | Save snapshot when...                                    | Scope of the snapshot  | Location(s) to save the snapshot                     |
         | [x]    |                       | combo file | Logic-based       | Logic becomes true: [participant_consent_complete]='2... | All instruments        | File Repository Specified field: [combo_file]        |

      When I enter "combo file" into the input field labeled "Search"
      Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in a table:
