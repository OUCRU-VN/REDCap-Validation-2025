Feature: C.3.24.0305. User Interface: The system shall support the e-Consent Framework to mark surveys as complete (with the submit button appearing) once the certification step is successfully completed. This includes functionality for single forms, repeatable forms, multi-signature forms, surveys with conditional logic, and surveys across multiple arms in both classic and longitudinal projects.
