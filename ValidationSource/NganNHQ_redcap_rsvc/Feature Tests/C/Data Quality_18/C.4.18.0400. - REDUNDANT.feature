    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Data Quality Module is functioning as expected

    Scenario: C.4.18.0400.100
#     #This feature test is REDUNDANT and can be viewed in C.4.18.0300.100 & C.4.18.0500.

#     Scenario: C.4.18.0100.100 Default data quality rules
#     Scenario: C.4.18.0500.100 View discrepancies
