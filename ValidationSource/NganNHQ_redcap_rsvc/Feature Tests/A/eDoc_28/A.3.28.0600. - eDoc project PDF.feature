Feature: Project Settings: The system shall allow project-level enabling or disabling of external storage for non-e-Consent governed PDF Snapshots containing completed e-Consent responses.
  As a REDCap administrator
  I want to control whether non-e-Consent governed snapshots are stored externally
  So that storage behavior aligns with regulatory and institutional policies

  Scenario: A.3.28.0600.100 Verify default behavior (ON) for new projects
    #SETUP
    Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
    And I create a new project named "A.3.28.0600.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "24EConsentWithSetup.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button
    #VERIFY default setting ON
    When I click on the link labeled "Edit Project Settings"
    Then I should see the dropdown field labeled "Store non-e-Consent governed PDF Snapshots on the External Storage server" with the option "Enabled" selected

  Scenario: A.3.28.0600.200 Disable External Storage for non-e-Consent governed snapshots
    Then if running via automation, start sftp server
    #ACTION: Disable setting
    And I select "Disabled" on the dropdown field labeled "Store non-e-Consent governed PDF Snapshots on the External Storage server"
    And I click on the button labeled "Save Changes"
    Then I should see "Your changes have been saved"
    #ACTION: Add a new record with a completed e-Consent

    #VERIFY: Snapshot is stored in File Repository only
    When I click on the link labeled "File Repository"
    And I click on the link labeled "PDF Snapshot Archive"
    Then I should see "pid13_formParticipantConsent_id1_"
    Then I should NOT see a file on the External Storage server whose name contains "pid13_formParticipantConsent_id1_"

    #Manual: Other options besides SFTP must currently be tested manually, though they could likely be automated.
    And I enter "redcap_docker-sftp-1" into the third input field labeled "Server hostname"
