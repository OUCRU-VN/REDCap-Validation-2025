Feature: A.3.28.0100. Control Center: The system shall allow administrators to configure local or external file storage solutions for REDCap uploads (e.g., Local, Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, WebDAV).
As a REDCap administrator   

 I want to verify that the File Upload Settings allow for local file storage   
 So that uploaded PDF snapshots are correctly saved and retrievable 

#IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: This requirement supports multiple REDCap file storage configuration options: 
## Local, Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and WebDAV. 
## Each method is tested in its own scenario. 
## Sites should only run the scenarios relevant to their environment. 
## REDCap does not confirm external file receipt; verification of external storage must be done at the site level (D). 

  Scenario: Start external storage services
    # Start these right away to give them plenty of time to spin up before we need them
    Then if running via automation, start external storage services

  Scenario: A.3.28.0100.0100. Configure Local File Storage
# Default REDCap configuration storing files in /edocs/ or another local path. No external setup or credentials required. 
      #SETUP
